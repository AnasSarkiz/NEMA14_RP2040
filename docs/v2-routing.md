# V2 routing verification

**All 70 physical net groups are connected: zero shorts, zero native DRC errors
or warnings, and zero floating copper islands.** The mistaken connector rotation
was reverted; the WAGO 250-204 faces outward. The ordered V1 and public tscircuit
package are unchanged.

The saved four-layer board contains 639 trace records and 359 through vias.
Every report in the manifest is bound to the exact routed JSON SHA-256. The
independent physical audit uses the actual supplier pad, wire, plated-barrel and
pour geometry. It finds zero foreign-net clearance, board-edge, mounting-hole,
keepout or construction violations. All 342 physical pin/net assignments and
all source placement records match the reviewed source.

Native DRC, independent connectivity/clearance, schema, source, placement and
TypeScript checks pass. The functional audit verifies all six motor-current paths
at a minimum 0.30 mm width, all four amplifier pickups joining the main conductors
only at their shunt lands, and a top-only oscillator without vias. USB land
contacts were extended into the real pads; conductive connections do not rely on
port labels. Floating fragments and endpoint stubs were removed while preserving
the physical pad partitions. Copper normalization preserves real wire geometry
and every real layer-changing barrel.

## Construction rules

Foreign-net copper clearance is at least 0.15 mm; board-edge copper clearance is
at least 0.25 mm. Ordinary vias have at least 0.45 mm pads, 0.30 mm drills and
0.075 mm annuli. Three separately validated 0.50/0.30 mm GND thermal vias occupy
the MCU, PD and driver exposed pads. Every other via is subject to the strict
native via-in-pad check.

The Ø6.4 mm screw-head envelopes apply on both external surfaces. Inner copper
may pass under the insulated FR4 surface, with at least 0.25 mm copper clearance
from each actual Ø3.2 mm mounting hole on every layer. Through vias stay outside
the head envelopes. The minimum mounting-hole copper gap is 0.2556 mm. Supplier
USB locating holes and plated lands retain their imported geometry; the separate
0.1248 mm supplier land-to-locating-hole gap is reported, not confused with a
mounting-hole waiver. NPTH copper overlaps are rejected.

The current screen uses the actual fixed VREF network: nominal current limit
0.351 A, screened worst-case trip 0.378 A. Two inner1 phase sections are 13.882
and 8.824 mm long, at least 0.30 mm wide. The 17.5 µm internal-copper / 20 °C
IPC-2221 estimate is 0.410 A. This sizing estimate does not qualify operating
temperature or authorize raising the current limit. USB ground reference,
thermal/power integrity, wire/tool access, procurement and hardware calibration
remain engineering release work. `fabrication_ready` stays false and order-file
export/publication gates remain blocked.

## Reproduce and preview

From the repository root, with Bun and the Python geometry environment installed:

```sh
npm run check:v2:source
npm run check:v2:placement
npm run typecheck
npm run check:circle
npm run check:v2:routing
npm run check:v2:routing:native
npm run check:v2:functional
npm run check:v2:phase-current
node scripts/check-native-schema.mjs artifacts/v2/routing/freerouted.circuit.json
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/workspace/.config tsci check shorts artifacts/v2/routing/freerouted.circuit.json --mode gerber --layer all --pixels-per-mm 100
npm run route:v2
npm run dev
```

`route:v2` restores the checked saved routing to `index.circuit.json` and
`artifacts/board.circuit.json` only when source, routed copper and required proof
hashes match the manifest. `build:v2` rebuilds source previews and automatically
restores that copper only if still valid. Source-only previews remain explicitly
unrouted. The standalone routing HTML embeds its exact checked board, models,
fonts and rendering runtime; download it and open in Chrome for PCB, 3D and
schematic views.

`route:v2:freerouting` and `route:v2:native` are experimental rerouting commands;
use an isolated copy because they can replace saved copper. Repair scripts use
`artifacts/v2/routing/freerouted.circuit.json` by default. Ground fill is rebuilt
after geometry edits, then all checks must be rerun before a new manifest is
accepted. No native errors or warnings are hidden in the viewer.
